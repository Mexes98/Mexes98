- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mexes, a newbie in a web development. 
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development, starting with the front end stack though. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics; html, css and javascript. Looking to fully grasp these, before learning any frameworks. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects using just these languages, to aid and improve on my learning. 

- 📫 You can send an email to Secujnr@gmail.com
